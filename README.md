# Python Miscellaneous Scripts

A collection of miscellaneous Python scripts for testing, development, and experimentation. This repository contains various standalone Python utilities, prototypes, and development tools that don't belong to any specific project.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a workspace for:
- Quick Python prototypes and experiments
- Testing new libraries and frameworks
- Development utilities and helper scripts
- Code snippets and examples
- Learning and educational scripts

## Structure

```
python-misc/
├── scripts/          # Standalone utility scripts
├── experiments/      # Experimental code and prototypes
├── tests/           # Test files and examples
└── utils/           # Reusable utility modules
```

## Usage

Each script is designed to be self-contained. Navigate to the specific script directory and run:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

## Dependencies

Dependencies for individual scripts are managed through `requirements.txt`. Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For isolated environments, consider using virtual environments:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contributing

This is a personal development repository. Scripts should be:
- Well-documented with clear purpose
- Self-contained when possible
- Include usage examples in comments or docstrings
